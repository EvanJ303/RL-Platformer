# RL-Platformer
Deep Q-Learning applied to a simple platformer game. The hybrid agent uses a deep Q-network along with a small and infrequently-called fixed policy to help streamline the bot's gameplay.

## Dependencies
PyTorch, Pygame, Numpy

## Usage 
Create a folder called "data" in your working directory and create a folder called "models" inside of it. Run the training script to train and save the agent and run the inference script to showcase it.
